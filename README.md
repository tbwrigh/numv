# NumV

NumV is intended to be the basis of a linear algebra libary for Vlang. The original idea was to have similar functionality to numpy, but currently the end goal is a powerful linear algebra library.

## Matrix

matrix.v contains all the functions and structs related to mtrices

#### Matrix Functionality

Currently Matrix supports:
- [x] Generating Zero Matrices
- [x] Generating Filled Matrices
- [x] Generating Identity Matrices
- [x] Matrix Multiplication
- [x] An Apply Function
- [x] Getting Matrix Determinant
- [x] matrix inverse
- [x] matrix addition/substraction
- [x] matrix multiplication
- [x] matrix transpose

Needs to be supported:
- [ ] tbd

## Other

numv.v will eventually hold utility functions not related to the items mentioned above
