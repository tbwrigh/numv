# NumV

NumV is intended to be the basis of a linear algebra libary for Vlang. The original idea was to have similar functionality to numpy, but currently the end goal is a powerful linear algebra library.

## Matrix

matrix.v contains all the functions and structs related to mtrices

#### Matrix Functionality

Currently Matrix supports:
[x] Generating Zero Matrices
[x] Generating Filled Matrices
[x] Generating Identity Matrices
[x] Matrix Multiplication
[x] An Apply Function
[x] Getting Matrix Determinant

Needs to be supported:
[ ] Matrix Inverse
[ ] Matrix Multiplication By Constant? (This technically can be achieved with apply)

## Other

numv.v will eventually hold utility functions not related to the items mentioned above
